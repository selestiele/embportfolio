          <div><h4>The Task</h4>
          <p>The client was looking to redesign her wine blog so she could move it from Blogger to a self-hosted Wordpress site, and wanted to have a custom theme.</p></div>
          <div class="process"><h4>My Process</h4>
          <p>I researched a number of award-winning wine blogs to see how they structured their websites. Many of them had a magazine or newspaper feel, and some had images of the blogger as part of their "look." After discussion with the client, we decided to go for a look that would resemble a country Italian caf&#233. We wanted it to have a comfortable, home-y feel, but still clearly indicate what the content focused on. </p>
          <div><h5>Image/Color Choices</h5>
          <p>The color choices came mainly from the image chosen for the background. A reddish-brown was used for the icons and main content, while a dark green was used for areas like headings. To keep the text from getting lost in the background image, a background in pale yellow (set at lower opacity) was used. This allowed the image to show through, but not compete with the content. </p></div>
          <div><h5>Typeface Choices</h5>
          <p>The typefaces were chosen based on their "feel." The title of the website was not only handwritten, but also had a gritty texture like chalk on a chalkboard. This was used also in the "chalkboard" menu. For the headings, I decided to use a contemporary, sans-serif font, with a hint of serif elegance in the contrasting thick and thin strokes. The main body of the text is a serif font.</p></div>

          <div><h4>The Task</h4>
          <p>Create a poster with positive imagery, using paths and shapes, filters, and adjustments.</p></div>

          <div class="process"><h4>My Process</h4>
          <p>There were few requirements, making the project wide open for interpretation. When I think of positive imagery, I think of the beach and vacation. For this reason, I decided to go for a vacation resort-type advertisement.</p>
          
          <div><h5>Image/Color Choices</h5>
          <p>The images chosen for this project were chosen to evoke happiness and a sense of relaxation. To simulate personal vacation photographs, I used a Polaroid shape and coloring. Shades of blue and green rounded out the background color, and the halftone filter gave the background image a nostalgic feeling.</p></div>

          <div><h5>Typeface Choices</h5>
          <p>For the typefaces, I decided to use a modern, sans-serif font for its clean and readable lines. The second was a script font which looked like it could be handwritten. I then applied a ripple effect to make it appear as though it was under water. </p></div>
